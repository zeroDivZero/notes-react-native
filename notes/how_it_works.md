![How RN app is built](../assets/how_it_builds.png)

JS code for common functionality across platforms, and platform-specific code (to access features unique to platform), are built with RN build tool (command line or Android Studio/Xcode) to generate APK (Android) or IPA (iOS).

RN components have native platform equivalents.
