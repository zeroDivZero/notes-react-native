# CREATE (`init`) and RUN (`run`)

## Create

```zsh
react-native init <project name>
```

## Run

In project folder:

```zsh
react-native run-ios
```

First time takes time to build app. If app doesn't automatically launch in simulator, browse in simulator and open manually.

Or, navigate to `ios` folder in project and open `.xcodeproj`.
